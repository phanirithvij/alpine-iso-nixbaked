About Teaiso
============

This is just a Live ISO generator, but wait! **It's not what you think! It generates any linux iso in a simple way**, with a generic method.

The mayor feature its that **produces ISO of any kind of linux distribution** as base.

The simplest equivalent is Debian's `live-build`, but without so many complications, just add packages, create the iso starting mechanisms, but without changing the nature of the base distro to be generated.
